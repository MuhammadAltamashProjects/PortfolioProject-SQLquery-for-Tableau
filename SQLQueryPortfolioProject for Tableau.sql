-- 1. 
--To show global death percentage due to covid

Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
where continent is not null 
--Group By date
order by 1,2

-- Just a double check based off the data provided
-- numbers are extremely close so we will keep them - The Second includes "International"  Location


--Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
--From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
----Where location like '%states%'
--where 
-- continent is  null
----Group By date
--order by 1,2


-- 2. 

-- We take these out as they are not inluded in the above queries and want to stay consistent
-- European Union is part of Europe
--To show a bar graph of total deaths in each continent

Select location, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
Where continent is null 
and location not in ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
Group by location
order by TotalDeathCount desc


-- 3.
-- Using maxinfectedcases to figure out how much percent population is affected in total
--To create a map with death percentage of each country

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, 
Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
Group by location, population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- 4.
--To create line graph for specific countries for good visualization


Select Location, Population,date, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
